The w3canvas software packages, are an attempt to put into public domain, the components necessary to reproduce simple web content and web applications. Bjoern Lindberg bouncing blob demonstration is a simple test used throughout the software, showing animation, keyboard and mouse responses, and occasionally stealing a smile from observers. The demonstration, and the libraries it uses in w3canvas, are all public domain. The demonstration uses HTML5, and so runs naturally on supporting browsers. It may run in Java and Flash, in browsers that do not support HTML5, just as it may run on the desktop, using those virtual hosts.

Supporting older computing systems, supporting computers that have not been updated in more than ten years. They exist, across the world, and while they may not be useful for video editing, they can certainly demonstrate a bouncing blob, and reproduce other web applications and content. With w3canvas, web content can be distributed in a self-hosting manner; as a public domain package, any corporation may re-use the work to develop their own products. As a self-hosting package, users can access content, across the widest range of devices.

Antoine Quint's SVG library is currently being integrated with the basic HTML Forms implementation already released.
