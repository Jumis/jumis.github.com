Considering the vast collection of literate developers online and able to contribute: things are moving a bit slow in software development.
Open source communities are often unable to re-use code, not because of technical ability, or code quality, but because the proprietary licenses attached to code bases, need to lock up. Public domain software released by reputable sources is accepted as a universal donor.
Consider these four popular licensing types: LGPL and BSD, MPL and Apache. They're all giant repositories of re-usable code fragments, but all require extra-care if licenses are to be mixed. This means that MPL producers must re-write code which is otherwise available in open source, that BSD producers must do the same, and on and on.
