title: On Public Software Development
---

Considering the vast collection of literate developers online and able to contribute: things are moving a bit slow in software development.
Open source communities are often unable to re-use code, not because of technical ability, or code quality, but because the proprietary licenses attached to code bases, need to lock up. Public domain software released by reputable sources is accepted as a universal donor.
Consider these four popular licensing types: LGPL and BSD, MPL and Apache. They're all giant repositories of re-usable code fragments, but all require extra-care if licenses are to be mixed. This means that MPL producers must re-write code which is otherwise available in open source, that BSD producers must do the same, and on and on.

Example:

SQLite is a library released into the public domain by a US company: it's used pervasively for storage in both Mozilla Firefox and the WebKit family, notably Google Chrome and Apple Safari. It's used in Apple iOS systems, it's on Google Android devices. These three corporations were able to use SQLite in their software because it is public domain, it's unencumbered by license restrictions.

DJB is the signature of a cryptography expert who has published several public domain software projects. Bernstein released qmail, a mail transfer agent, tinydns, a domain name server, two software packages installed on hundreds of thousands of servers on the internet. Their public domain status means that anyone can include the packages and re-use code, without restriction.

The Open Icon Library distributes a repository of vector graphics, Thatcher Ulrich has released public domain fonts, and a wealth of re-usable C++ code. ImageJ contains a wealth of Java code.

I don't need to provide a link to any of these; they're extremely well established and can easily be found via search engine. Merely sharing those names with you, is enough to give you access to hundreds of thousands of lines of code, which you can use without any restrictions.

Ostrowski made a case for public domain software in 1985, in adherence of the Berne Convention, software must be released into the public domain, explicitly. Many prolific developers have released code to the public, including in their public domain dedication, the phrase "do what you will". These include Julian Assange founder of Wikileaks and John Walker founder Autodesk.

Michael Deal has released a significant browser demonstration, to make over a hundred classic compositions more accessible, and like the compositions, the majority of his code is public domain. 

Many of these projects were released by groups motivated to enhance the free market, hoping to make commercial software development less expensive, and in turn, improve the production of software as a whole, regardless of licenses, languages, platforms, regardless of anything. They created work, work which could be reused by anybody, and released it.

As browser vendors move on, into mobile phones, into tablets, into the latest versions of the big three operating systems, they leave behind "obsolete" hardware, software, and in doing so, leave behind many computer users. They focus on new file formats, and refining a limited set of standards. In that, they leave behind the old.

Projects like dlgvu serve as documentation of a format, Max McGuire found himself looking at public domain code, when trying to understand the format used by a popular video game: the code that the actual video game developer had released was not as useful as the code available in public domain. Twenty years from now, that code can still be used, printed or published, without conditions, should someone want to document the format again.

These examples show how public domain dedications can reduce the cost of commerce, enabling large corporations and self-publishing individuals, to engage computing technology.

The w3canvas software packages, are an attempt to put into public domain, the components necessary to reproduce simple web content and web applications. Antoine Quint's bouncing blob demonstration is a simple test used throughout the software, showing animation, keyboard and mouse responses, and occasionally stealing a smile from observers. The demonstration, and the libraries it uses in w3canvas, are all public domain. The demonstration uses HTML5, and so runs naturally on supporting browsers. It may run in Java and Flash, in browsers that do not support HTML5, just as it may run on the desktop, using those virtual hosts.

We hope to stretch further, supporting older computing systems, supporting computers that have not been updated in more than ten years. They exist, across the world, and while they may not be useful for video editing, they can certainly demonstrate a bouncing blob, and reproduce other web applications and content. With w3canvas, web content can be distributed in a self-hosting manner; as a public domain package, any corporation may re-use the work to develop their own products. As a self-hosting package, users can access content, across the widest range of devices.
