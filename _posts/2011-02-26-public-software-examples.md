SQLite is a library released into the public domain by a US company: it's used pervasively for storage in both Mozilla Firefox and the WebKit family, notably Google Chrome and Apple Safari. It's used in Apple iOS systems, it's on Google Android devices. These three corporations were able to use SQLite in their software because it is public domain, it's unencumbered by license restrictions.

DJB is the signature of a cryptography expert who has published several public domain software projects. Bernstein released qmail, a mail transfer agent, tinydns, a domain name server, two software packages installed on hundreds of thousands of servers on the internet. Their public domain status means that anyone can include the packages and re-use code, without restriction.

The Open Icon Library distributes a repository of vector graphics, Thatcher Ulrich has released public domain fonts, and a wealth of re-usable C++ code. ImageJ contains a wealth of Java code.

I don't need to provide a link to any of these; they're extremely well established and can easily be found via search engine. Merely sharing those names with you, is enough to give you access to hundreds of thousands of lines of code, which you can use without any restrictions.

Ostrowski made a case for public domain software in 1985, in adherence of the Berne Convention, software must be released into the public domain, explicitly. Many prolific developers have released code to the public, including in their public domain dedication, the phrase "do what you will". These include Julian Assange founder of Wikileaks and John Walker founder Autodesk.

Michael Deal has released a significant browser demonstration, to make over a hundred classic compositions more accessible, and like the compositions, the majority of his code is public domain. 

Many of these projects were released by groups motivated to enhance the free market, hoping to make commercial software development less expensive, and in turn, improve the production of software as a whole, regardless of licenses, languages, platforms, regardless of anything. They created work, work which could be reused by anybody, and released it.

As browser vendors move on, into mobile phones, into tablets, into the latest versions of the big three operating systems, they leave behind "obsolete" hardware, software, and in doing so, leave behind many computer users. They focus on new file formats, and refining a limited set of standards. In that, they leave behind the old.

Projects like dlgvu serve as documentation of a format, Max McGuire found himself looking at public domain code, when trying to understand the format used by a popular video game: the code that the actual video game developer had released was not as useful as the code available in public domain. Twenty years from now, that code can still be used, printed or published, without conditions, should someone want to document the format again.

These examples show how public domain dedications can reduce the cost of commerce, enabling large corporations and self-publishing individuals, to engage computing technology.
